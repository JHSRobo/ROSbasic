## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

FOLLOW:
*  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C32ucQTIAsE2H7u9OERmmCfyc6WzUvhrB2U6_GgZuWg/edit?usp=sharing

Initial SETUP:
* `cd ~/Desktop`
* `git clone https://github.com/Michael-Equi/ROV_Test_Bench.git`
* `cd ROV_Test_Bench/scripts`
* `./GitSetup,sh`
* `./setup.sh`
    
*Always run IDE's from terminal if on Ubuntu (just type the name of the IDE in terminal and click enter ex. clion)
Only develop with clion, webstorm, pycharm, and arduino*

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Code Blocks IDE on rpi ubuntu mate
* `sudo apt-get install codeblocks`

I2C interface on Ubutnu Mate
* `cd /boot/config.txt`
* uncomment `dtparam=i2c_arm=off` and change to `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`
* uncomment `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=100000` and change to `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=400000`
* restart pi


```
Give examples
```
### Network Setup

What things you need to do so that the ROS network operates properly 

On ubuntu 16.04 go to Network Connections app and add a new ethernet connection (name the connection `ROVEthernetConnection`)
* On the topside computer have a static (manual) IP of `192.168.1.100`, netmask `24`, Gateway `92.168.1.1`, DNS server `27.0.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 192.168.1.1`
* On the bottomside computer have a static (manual) IP of `192.168.1.111`, netmask `24`, Gateway `192.168.1.1`, DNS server `127.0.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 192.168.1.1`
* Run the setupROSNetwork.sh script in the scripts folder

Once the network connection has been verified (on bottomside `ping master` / on topside `ping bottomside`)
* Run `sshSetup.sh` in the scripts folder
* Do not add any paraphrases 
* on bottomside `ssh master` / on topside `ssh bottomside`
* Make sure both work without entering a password 

#### Network Setup DEBUG
* IF you recieve `/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: ssh: connect to host bottomside port 22: Connection refused` go to the opposite machine from the one you recieved it on and run the following:
    * `sudo rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    * `sudo apt-get purge openssh-server`
    * `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`
    * `./sshSetup.sh`

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

On your Raspberry Pi 3 B make sure you are running ubuntu mate 16.04 (image here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1497jupJ2dBQqy_o_x5JBPTjY3lto7-rI)
* cat /etc/os-release
* https://www.intorobotics.com/how-to-install-ros-kinetic-on-raspberry-pi-3-running-raspbian-stretch-lite/
* http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick (replace indigo with kinetic)

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
