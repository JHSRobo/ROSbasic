# uart_thrusters_arduino

## Description

This is the core firmware and logic for the bottomside arduino microntroller. This firmware is equiped with a new packet parsing algorith and thruster control software. This was chosen to provide a reliable independant microcontroller for additional safety features over a direct I2C to PWM converter or PWM signals generated by the main bottomside computer.
